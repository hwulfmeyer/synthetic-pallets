# Pallet Pose Estimation from RGB Images

## 1. Data Collection and Annotation:

### a. Capture Images
- Capture a dataset of RGB images of pallets in various poses and lighting conditions.

### b. Annotate Images
- Annotate the images with key points. These should be consistently identifiable points on the pallet, such as corner points or specific intersections on the pallet slats.

## 2. Key Point Detection:

### a. Train ML Model
- Train a machine learning model to detect the key points on the pallet from the RGB images. Examples of architectures include:
  - **Heatmap-based methods**: Predict a heatmap for each key point, with the brightest spot indicating the position.
  - **Direct regression**: Directly regress the 2D pixel coordinates of each key point.

### b. Model Output
- The trained model should output the 2D pixel coordinates of the key points on the pallet when provided an RGB image.

## 3. Pose Estimation using PnP:

### a. Pre-requisites
- **2D key point coordinates**: From the detected key points in the image.
- **3D real-world coordinates**: Of those key points on a standard pallet. For instance, `(0, 0, 0)` for the bottom left corner and `(1, 0, 0)` for the bottom right if the pallet width is 1m.

### b. PnP Algorithm
- Use the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm to find the pose (rotation and translation) that best aligns the detected 2D key points with their known 3D positions. Tools like OpenCV have PnP implementations.

## 4. Refinement:

### a. Initial Pose Estimate
- Refine the pose by minimizing reprojection errors. Adjust the pose to make the projected 3D key points align as closely as possible with the detected 2D key points.

### b. Iterative Refinement
- Refine the pose until the reprojection error is minimized or reaches an acceptable threshold.

## 5. Evaluation:

### a. Test the System
- Evaluate the system on a separate dataset (not used for training) to check its accuracy.

### b. Accuracy Metrics
- Check error metrics (X and Y precision, rotation error). If they meet requirements, the system is ready for deployment. Otherwise, consider refining the process.

## Implementation Tips:

- **Data Augmentation**: Use data augmentation to increase dataset size and diversity during training.
- **Camera Calibration**: Ensure you've calibrated your camera for accurate PnP results.
- **Consistent Key Points**: Choose key points that are consistently detectable across various pallet orientations and conditions.
